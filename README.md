## 25 Office Floor Building Project

This repository contains the BIM model of a **25-floor office building**, developed using **Revit Architecture** and **Revit Structure**. It demonstrates my ability to create detailed architectural and structural designs, coordinate complex systems, and manage large-scale commercial projects.

### Tools Used:
- **Revit Architecture**: Utilized for architectural design, including floor plans, elevations, and 3D modeling of the office building.
- **Revit Structure**: Employed for structural modeling, integrating elements such as beams, columns, and foundations.
- **Navisworks**: Used for clash detection and model coordination, ensuring all disciplines were seamlessly integrated.
- **BIM 360**: Facilitated cloud-based collaboration, document management, and team coordination throughout the project.

### Project Overview:
- **Building Type**: 25-floor office building
- **Key Features**: Detailed architectural and structural models, clash-free coordination between different building systems, comprehensive construction documentation.
- **Scope of Work**: From conceptual design to detailed modeling, system coordination, and final construction documentation for all 25 floors.

### Project Highlights:
- Architectural modeling of office spaces, including floor plans, common areas, and building exterior.
- Structural coordination to integrate steel, concrete, and reinforcement systems with the architectural design.
- Successful application of clash detection using Navisworks to resolve conflicts between building systems.
- Delivery of complete project documentation, including construction drawings, schedules, and material take-offs.
